# Hello OpenCV

## Dependencies

Just tinkering with the Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) library.

To install the library depencies on MacOS I used Homebrew.

```bash
brew install homebrew/science/opencv3 \
    --with-contrib \
    --with-ffmpeg \
    --with-gstreamer \
    --with-qt5
```

Homebrew gives some instructions for linking to the keg-only package,
I won't cover that here now because it depends a lot on what is used
for build tooling.

Use homebrew-installed libraries with `pkg-config` by adding the
library's pkgconfig directory to PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH.

```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/opencv3/lib/pkgconfig/:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```

This can be loaded anywhere, but I recommend a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
or some other environment-file loader tool.

## Goal

Just tinkering in C++ with OpenCV. Primarily trying to build something
like [Wesley the Augmented Whiteboard](https://github.com/martinhj/wesleywhiteboard).
I may try to get this working on a Raspberry Pi so that I can use it as
a dedicated augmented whiteboard appliance in my office. Undecided at
this time.
